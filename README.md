Sure, here's an attractive and effective version of the README file with detailed steps, bulletins, commands, and proper structuring:

# WorkhubPro ERP System

## üì± Setting up the Project

### üêò Setting up PostgreSQL

1. First, pull the Docker image of PostgreSQL 15:

```bash
docker pull postgres:15-alpine
```

2. Use the provided Makefile for PostgreSQL operations:

- Initialize the image for local development:

```bash
make postgresinit
```

- Open the PostgreSQL console (psql):

```bash
make postgres
```

- Create the database for users:

```bash
make createdbusers
```

- Drop the users database:

```bash
make dropdbusers
```

- Open the Bash console within the PostgreSQL container:

```bash
make bash
```

3. Using the PostgreSQL console (psql):

- List all available databases:

```sql
root=# \l
```

- Connect to a specific database:

```sql
root=# \c <your_database_name>
```

- Show all relations (tables) in the current database:

```sql
root=# \dt
```

- View all records in a table:

```sql
root=# SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
```

- Quit the PostgreSQL console:

```sql
root=# \q
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting PostgreSQL Issues

1. If you encounter an SSL Enabled error:

- Use the Bash console:

```bash
make bash
```

- Navigate to the PostgreSQL data directory:

```bash
f92622037df6:/# cd /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

- Check the SSL setting:

```bash
f92622037df6:/# cat postgresql.conf | grep ssl
```

- If the first line is not `ssl = off`, uncomment the line `# ssl = off`:

```bash
f92622037df6:/# vi postgresql.conf
```

- Demote yourself to a normal user and restart the PostgreSQL service:

```bash
f92622037df6:/# su - postgres
f92622037df6:~$ pg_ctl restart
```

- If the Docker image has stopped running, restart it from Docker Desktop.

- Try using the PostgreSQL service again. It should work now.
